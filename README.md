A quick and easy survey to find out which Sailor Scout would be your BFF

## Built With ##
* Node.js
* Express
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

## Summary ##

This is a full stack project that uses path routing on the backend to direct users to the requested pages. There are three pages users can navigate to:

* The home page/landing page
* The friends page (which shows the friends you can be matched with)
* The survey page

After the user completes the survey, they are matched with a BFF who has the closest score to the user. The user is notified via a modal that pops up once their score has been calculated. 

## Roadmap ##

Since the file structure setup for Express is so specific, I wasn't able to add any external CSS through a file like I would normally. In the future, I'd love to add some styling to this project to make it feel more interactive.
